        <h3 class="blue-text">Why SizeMeApp?</h3>
        <p>SizeMeApp is designed to solve one of online shopping’s biggest challenges—finding the right fit.

    <!-- How it works! -->

        <i class="info-icon-secondary fa-solid fa-gears icon-medium"></i>
        <h3 class="blue-text">How It Works!</h3>
        <p>SizeMeApp uses advanced technology to match body measurements with garment specifications, ensuring a precise fit for every shopper. By inputting key measurements—chest, waist, hips, and shoulders—the app compares this data to the exact sizing charts of different brands and styles. Instead of relying on generic size labels, SizeMeApp analyzes how each garment is designed to fit, accounting for factors like fabric stretch, cut, and fit type. This personalized approach helps shoppers find the best size instantly, reducing the need for returns and improving the overall online shopping experience.</p>
