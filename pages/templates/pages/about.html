        <h2 class="blue-text">Why SizeMeApp?</h2>
        <p>SizeMeApp is designed to solve one of online shopping’s biggest challenges—finding the right fit. Instead of guessing or ordering multiple sizes, users can input their precise measurements for more accurate recommendations. This reduces unnecessary returns, saving time, money, and the environment. Retailers benefit from fewer returns and higher customer satisfaction. With SizeMeApp, shoppers can buy with confidence, knowing their clothes will fit perfectly the first time.</p>

    <!-- How it works! -->
    <section class=" about-box text-center transparent-box">
        <i class="info-icon-secondary fa-solid fa-gears icon-medium"></i>
        <h2 class="blue-text">How It Works!</h2>
        <p>SizeMeApp uses advanced technology to match body measurements with garment specifications, ensuring a precise fit for every shopper. By inputting key measurements—chest, waist, hips, and shoulders—the app compares this data to the exact sizing charts of different brands and styles. Instead of relying on generic size labels, SizeMeApp analyzes how each garment is designed to fit, accounting for factors like fabric stretch, cut, and fit type. This personalized approach helps shoppers find the best size instantly, reducing the need for returns and improving the overall online shopping experience.</p>
